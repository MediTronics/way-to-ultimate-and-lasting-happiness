# Way to Ultimate and Lasting Happiness and Peace

One of the greatest discoveries in ancient India, is that of the Buddha, who discovered the reason why being experience stress, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair and the way to overcome it. Following explores techniques to develop oneself socially and psychologically to understand our cognitive and physiological processors, to the extent that it leads to the arising of stress, with a view to come out of stress altogether and prevent the arising of it again.

One source of our stress is social interaction. We should aim to harmonise our behavioural aspects to be in peace with society and interpersonal interaction at large. This lead to some level of happiness and content. This basic level of peace is the basis of further mental cultivation. 

Using the peace then, further mental development is undertaken to harmonise our expectations and out look of the world so that worldly events and experiences does not effect our happiness. The calm and serenity gained in this stage is the basis to further understand the underlying psychological and physiological processes and how this leads to stress and ultimately who one can stay stress free.

Different personal experiences lead to stress. Once a person develops  empirical insights based on direct experience of these processes, one can stay aloof from what creates stress and harmonise oneself with that does not create stress. Once one is fully established in the wisdom gained from the direct experience of how stress is created and how it can be avoided, one can immunise oneself from creating or asising of any further stress, where by one is released from stress entirely.
